# Ideas

Every idea ever considered in this repository, kept permanently.

Nothing is deleted from this file. An idea that was rejected stays recorded with
the reason, so no future run spends usage rediscovering it, re-searching it, or
re-arguing it. Three runs have already lost time to this: two of them
independently generated the same cron-linter idea and independently searched and
rejected it, because neither could see the other's work.

**Read this file during Phase 1 intake, before generating any candidate.** It is
part of the repository's memory, not an appendix.

## How to use it

* Every candidate that gets as far as being considered goes in, whatever happens
  to it. No idea is too dead to record.
* File it under exactly one heading, by outcome.
* Include the date, the hook sentence attempt (even a failed one), what was
  searched, and the specific reason for the outcome. Links to prior art are
  required in section 2.
* An idea may be **moved** between sections when something real changes — a hook
  is found, prior art turns out to be weaker than it looked, the environment gains
  a capability. Moving it means editing its entry and noting what changed and
  when. It does not mean deleting the history.
* Never move an idea upward to justify building it. If the reason for the move is
  "I want to build this," that is not a reason.

## 1. Rejected — failed the rules

Ideas that failed a gate for reasons other than prior art: not feasible here, no
definition of done, no first step, no real problem, inside the shape ban, or
memorable but useless.

Format: **name** — date. Hook attempt. Which gate failed and exactly why.

_(none yet — the entries below were all rejected on prior art or on hype)_

## 2. Already done by someone else

Ideas dropped because materially equivalent work exists. Prior-art links are
mandatory. These are settled: do not re-search them without a specific reason to
think the landscape has changed, and if you do, record what changed.

### cron / crontab linter — rejected twice (2026-09-11, 2026-09-12)
Hook attempt: "checks your crontab for daylight-saving and escaping mistakes."
Considered independently on two runs, searched and rejected both times. Prior art:
[CronLens](https://github.com/SNO7E-G/CronLens) (lints cron expressions with DST,
overlap and thundering-herd warnings),
[cron-doctor](https://github.com/HeytalePazguato/cron-doctor) (ten lint checks),
[cronlint](https://github.com/zbcdo/cronlint), and `cronkit` (CLI crontab linting
with overlap detection and schedule projection). Same problem, same user, same
workflow. **Settled — do not consider a third time.** Also now inside the shape
ban.

### swapped-argument detector for Python — set aside (2026-09-12)
Hook attempt: "finds function calls whose arguments are in the wrong order."
Not built because the capability exists as research work, which would have capped
novelty confidence. Prior art: the DeepBugs IntelliJ plugin (incorrect function
arguments in Python), and
[eth-sri/learning-real-bug-detector](https://github.com/eth-sri/learning-real-bug-detector)
(argument-swap task). Also now inside the shape ban.

### CSV anti-join / join-diagnosis tool — rejected (2026-09-12)
Hook attempt: "tells you why your two spreadsheets didn't line up."
Prior art: Apify's CSV Anti-Join Finder, and the R package `joinspy`. Materially
equivalent.

## 3. Not hyped — passed the other rules, failed the hook

**This section is a resource, not a graveyard.** These ideas are real, buildable,
unclaimed, and satisfy the rules on problem value, feasibility, originality and
completeness. They failed only Gate F: no hook sentence a stranger would repeat,
or nothing that can be shown in ten seconds.

They are kept because a hook can be found later. An idea moves to section 4 when
someone writes a hook sentence that genuinely passes all four tests — surprising,
concrete, context-free, not a category label — or when the framing changes so that
the interesting part becomes the project. Very often the fix is scope, not
wording: the boring application was hiding a primitive worth building on its own.

Record for each: the hook attempts that failed, and what would have to be true for
it to become hyped.

### backfire (already built, 2026-09-11) — belongs here by today's rules
"Finds retry amplification and timeout blowups in Python codebases." Genuinely
useful, honestly validated, 85 tests. Fails Gate F: a category label, no demo, and
inside the shape ban. What would make it hyped: the composed-retry-multiplication
result shown **visually** — a diagram or animation of one click fanning out into
thirty requests across the call graph. The engine is interesting; the CLI report
hides it.

### orbiter (already built, 2026-09-12) — belongs here by today's rules
"Flags Python code that mixes units, like milliseconds passed as seconds." Strong
validation, 151 tests, real controls. Fails Gate F for the same reasons. What
would make it hyped: unit inference as something you can *see* — units propagating
through an expression live as you type, rather than a warning printed after.

## 4. Hyped and selected — building, or built

Ideas that passed every gate including Gate F, with a hook sentence that holds.
Each entry keeps its hook sentence verbatim, its status, and a link to its folder.
An entry stays here after completion; this doubles as the repository's back
catalogue.

### cutline (built 2026-09-12) — partially qualifies
Shipped as: "Reads one plain-text plan and decides whether everything fits."
Contains a genuinely strong idea that was not surfaced: an engine that **proves**
a set of commitments cannot all be met, emits a certificate you can check by hand,
and computes the provably cheapest subset to drop — verified against exhaustive
enumeration, 200 of 200. Better hook, available the whole time: *"Proves your plan
is impossible, then tells you the single cheapest thing to drop."* That engine
generalises to sprints, cloud budgets, timetables and CI minutes, and should have
been the project with the planner as one demo. Recorded as the worked example of
the ship-the-primitive rule.

_No project currently selected. The next entry here is the first one chosen under
the full rule set, and it should be the best idea this repository can find rather
than the first that qualifies._
